# Scripts

General-use scripts for productivity, automation, and later projects.  
These are small programs I write to automate tasks, learn programming, and experiment with Linux.

## Contents
- Bash scripts
- Python scripts
- Automation tools

## Usage
Each script has instructions in its file or in a dedicated markdown file.
